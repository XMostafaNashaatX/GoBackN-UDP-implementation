# GoBackN-UDP-implementation
This project involves the implementation of the Go-Back-N protocol in Python using the socket programming library. The Go-Back-N protocol is a sliding window protocol that uses a window of size ‘N’ to send multiple packets at once without waiting for individual acknowledgments.
